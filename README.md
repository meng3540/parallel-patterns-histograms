##Implementing and optimizing a CUDA-based histogram algorithm

### What is a Histogram?

A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of data. It displays the frequency or occurrence of values within specified intervals or bins. On a typical histogram, the horizontal axis is divided up into groups or bins (eg. a-d, e-h, i-l, etc.) and the number of occurrences of values in the data that are within a particular bin is graphed as a bar on the vertical axis. An example of a histogram is pictured below:

### Why Use CUDA/GPUs?

CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA for general-purpose computing on GPUs (Graphics Processing Units). CUDA allows developers to harness the immense parallel processing power of GPUs to accelerate a wide range of computational tasks, including histogram calculations. Some of the benefits CUDA offers for histogram generation are:

1. **Massive Parallelism:**
2. **Performance:**
3. **Optimized Memory Hierarchy: **
4. **Atomic Operations: **
5. **Scalability: **
